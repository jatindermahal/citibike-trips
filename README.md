# Introduction
This project shows the trips retrieved from an API.
It uses react along with some other 3rd party modules such as react bootstrap.

```
1. This is a single page application (SPA) with the added functionality of routing. This is achieved by using React Router.
1. On Trips page, all the trips are fetched from another application which is further connected to a database.
1. Use the arrows `<` and `>` at bottom of the page to navigate between pages
1. Each page shows 10 bike trips at a time
1. Different colors make Subscribers and Customers look separate from each other
1. Click each trip to get more details about that trip.
1. After a trip is clicked, it shows the details along with a map having start and end locations marked.
1. The user is allowed to update any trip by using react forms.
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
